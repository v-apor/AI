1: 21/05/2020: 	- NumPy Arrays and it's functions (cool stuff about broadcasting)
		- Types of selections i.e, fetching elements from arrays (np array indexing)
		- npArrays built in functions and operations (*,/,etc)
		- np exercise
2: 22/05/2020: - Pandas intro and pd.Series() 
		- Pandas dataframes (big one)
3: 23/05/2020: - Panda DataFrame handeling missing values
		- GroupBy (To group rows according to some column and the apply some aggregate functions)
		- Concat, Merge and Join DF
		- Operations in pandas
		- Input and output to DF (Only did csv, excel needs additional pkg to write, so only read it)
4: 24/05/2020: - Pandas Exercise: Felt the importance of doing exercises. I can see myself improving and getting to
		 use DataFrames
5: 25/05/2020: Started with Matplotlib. I'm having trouble showing the plot for .axes.... thing. Will Continue tomorrow.
6: 26/05/2020: Solved for axes, I had to run the emptyCanvasObj definition, axes creation and plotting on the same cell
	       - Canvas object creation using plt.figure() and it's axes i.e, subplots and putting labels , and titles.  
		- Saving image 
		- Customising plots color, style, marker etc

		- rugPlot (for frequency, used to create KDE)
		- kde plot

9: 29/05/2020: seaborn categorical plots
